I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Software Engineering at **Zhejiang University**, where I am under the guidance of Dr. [Sheng Zhou](https://zhoushengisnoob.github.io/). I'm also a research intern at **Alibaba Group**.


### Research Interests
My primary research areas include:
- Data Mining
- Weakly Supervised Learning
- Graph Neural Networks

I am actively seeking a **Ph.D. position** and **internship opportunity** to further advance my academic and research career. If you believe I'd be a good fit for your program or project, please feel free to contact me at <wongzhonghao123@gmail.com>.
